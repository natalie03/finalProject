      The Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model allows for consumers to purchase shares in the farm for a season in return for a specific amount of produce/product each week. Some farms have pick-up locations while others will deliver and most farms offer different size shares. It is important to think about purchasing a share before the season is in full swing so the farmers can plan accordingly and plant enough for everyone.
