      <h1 class="page-header">How It Works:</h1>
      <p>Here are the basics: a farmer offers a certain number of "shares" to the public. Typically the share consists of a box of vegetables, but other farm products may be included. Interested consumers purchase a share (aka a "membership" or a "subscription") and in return receive a box (bag, basket) of seasonal produce each week throughout the farming season.</p>

        <li>Receive payment early in the season, which helps with the farm's cash flow</li>
        <li>Have an opportunity to get to know the people who eat the food they grow</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>For Consumers:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat ultra-fresh food, with all the flavor and vitamin benefits</li>
        <li>Get exposed to new vegetables and new ways of cooking</li>
        <li>Usually get to visit the farm at least once a season</li>
        <li>Find that kids typically favor food from "their" farm even veggies they've never been known to eat</li>
        <li>Develop a relationship with the farmer who grows their food and learn more about how food is grown</li>
