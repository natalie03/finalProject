        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <p>Here are the basics: a farmer offers a certain number of "shares" to the public. Typically the share consists of a box of vegetables, but other farm products may be included. Interested consumers purchase a share (aka a "membership" or a "subscription") and in return receive a box (bag, basket) of seasonal produce each week throughout the farming season.</p>

        <h2>Benefits For Farmers:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Get to spend time marketing the food early in the year, before their 16 hour days in the field begin</li>
          <li>Receive payment early in the season, which helps with the farm's cash flow</li>
          <li>Have an opportunity to get to know the people who eat the food they grow</li>
        </ul>
